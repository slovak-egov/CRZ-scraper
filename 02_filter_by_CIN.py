# Changelog 10/2021:							 						|
# The filtering options were enhanced by:								|
# 	- Total minimum contract value (total amount of money paid for		|
# 	  contracted services)												|
# 	- Soonest publishing date (keep all the contracts after that date)	|
# --------------------------------------------------------------------  |
# Packages needed :  pandas, re											|
# --------------------------------------------------------------------  |
# Filter contracts from supplier list                                   |

# Recursive function date_is_equal_or_later()
#
# Returns if date1 is equal or later than date2. The processing takes place as follows:
#
# 1. Level 0 of both dates (year) is compared:
# 		- If year of date1 is later than year of date2, True is returned.
# 		- If year of date2 is later than year of date1, False is returned.
# 		- If both years are the same, level is incremented by 1 and the function calls
# 		  itself again (in deeper level) ->
# 		  ->
# 2. Level 1 of both dates (month) is compared:
# 		- If month of date1 is later than month of date2, True is returned.
# 		- If month of date2 is later than month of date1, False is returned.
# 		- If both months are the same, level is incremented by 1 and the function calls
# 		  itself again (in deeper level) ->
# 		  ->
# 3. Level 2 of both dates (day) is compared:
# 		- The drill is the same (either one value is bigger or smaller, or in case both
# 		  values are equal, deeper level is required). ->
# 		  ->
# ...
# 6. As the last possible recursive run, level 5 of both dates (seconds) is compared:
# 		- In case either seconds value is bigger or smaller, respective value is
# 		  returned.
# 		- In case both seconds values are equal, True is returned, which is a more
# 	      philosophical than numeric issue - the function is called
# 	      "date_is_equal_or_later", which means that in case both dates are equal
# 	      to the second, date1 is equal to date2, so that in order to follow
# 	      the function's name, it must return True.
# 		  In case the name was "date_is_later" (without the "equal" wording),
# 		  it would return False.
#
# Parameters:
# -----------
# date1, date2 =	The submitted dates must be in the following format:
# 					YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
# 					The actual placing of delimiters might differ (although there
# 					would not be much of a use for that), but there always must be
# 					maximum one delimiter of a kind between two values, from
# 					the following group: dash, space, colon).
#
# level =			Level of recursion for the function to know which value
# 					to extract from the dates:
# 					(year, month, day, hour, minute, second).
#
# Return value:
# -------------
# True =			date1 is equal or later than date2
# False =			date2 is later than date1
# None =			malformed dates were submitted to the function (ValueError)
#
