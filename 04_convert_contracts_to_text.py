# Explanation of the following options presented to the user.
#
# Originally, there were 2 scripts:
#
# 1. filter_text_contracts.py, which extracted text from contracts directly
# if possible ("textual" contracts), while putting those contracts
# in contracts_text folder and the not detectable (scanned) ones into
# the contracts_scan folder (without extracting any text).
#
# 2. OCR.py, which took the contracts from the contracts_scan folder, OCR'd
# their contents and put the results in contracts_text folder as well.
#
# After optimisation, these two scripts have been merged together, because
# the intermediary step - copying contracts into the contracts_scan folder,
# was redundant (and once not required, there was also no need for two
# separate scripts).
#
# The automated decision-making process was simplified in the following fashion:
#
# - Does the source contract file contain computer-readable text?
#    -> Yes: Extract text and save both PDF and TXT in contracts_text folder.
#    -> No: OCR the scanned PDF and save both PDF and TXT
#           in the contracts_text folder (further processing does not care
#           about whether the original was textual or scanned).
#
# However, the OCR process runs multiple-fold times longer than direct
# extraction of text and by running just filter_text_contracts before, the user
# was free of waiting for the OCR process to finish in exchange to be able
# to further process textual contracts only (this is especially useful in
# "needs to be done fast" scenarios).
# Similarly, it was possible to process only OCR when required
# (e.g. afterwards or even in parallel, finishing later).
#
# In order not to lose this flexibility after the merge, the following
# options were added to the beginning of the script. The options
# are self-explanatory.
